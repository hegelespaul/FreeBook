## Description
A repository of a very basic website that displays a lot of jazz standards progressions.

The data of all tunes is in `JazzStandards-url.json`. This file was extracted from the [JazzStandards repository](https://github.com/mikeoliphant/JazzStandards/tree/main) and complemented with the urls of youtube videos of all the tunes, a data made using a [youtube crawler](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pT4Gdu7ylKw6c5U14ebLyOfGdnVadVbM?usp=sharing).

Hopefully, there will be GUI updates in the near future. If not, it is because I'm too busy doing other stuff.
