## Description
A repository of a very basic website that displays a lot of jazz standards progressions.

The data of all tunes is in `JazzStandards.json`, a file extracted from the [JazzStandards repository](https://github.com/mikeoliphant/JazzStandards/tree/main).

Hopefully, there will be GUI updates in the near future. If not, it is because I'm too busy doing other stuff.
